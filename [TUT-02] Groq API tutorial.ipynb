We rushed to order, received the food and had to get out of there with no time to breathe (with a little exaggeration =/). Food, Lamb skewers were nicely cooked with good flavors. Mushroom croquet had a crispy exterior and soft inside. Mini sliders were delicious. Chorizo was pretty standard. The noodle paella with squid ink was a good concept and interesting. I did enjoy the flavor but the broken noodles under the squid was quite soggy. We really tried to like the dish but, hopefully, next time. If opportunity arises, I will try this place again.\"\n",
